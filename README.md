# Handwritten Digit Recognition using MNIST

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **handwritten digit classification system** using the **MNIST dataset**, which consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9).  
The goal is to accurately classify digits using a **machine learning approach (Logistic Regression)** and evaluate the model’s performance on unseen data.

This project demonstrates hands-on experience with **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and Python-based workflows**.
